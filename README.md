# Backdoors Attack Defense

Backdoors Attack Defense &mdash; is a PyTorch framework for state-of-the-art backdoor 
defenses and attacks on deep learning models. 
It includes real-world datasets, centralized and federated learning, and
supports various attack vectors. The code is mostly based on 
"[Blind Backdoors in Deep Learning Models (USENIX'21)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03823)" and
"[How To Backdoor Federated Learning (AISTATS'20)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00459)" papers,
 but we always look for incorporating newer results.

## Current status

We try to incorporate new attacks and defenses as well as to extend
the supported datasets and tasks.

### Backdoors
* Pixel-pattern (incl. single-pixel) - traditional pixel modification attacks.
* Physical - attacks that are triggered by physical objects.
* Semantic backdoors - attacks that don't modify the input (e.g. react on
 features already present in the scene).

*TODO* clean-label (good place to contribute).

### Injection methods
* Data poisoning - adds backdoors into the dataset.
* Batch poisoning - injects backdoor samples directly into the batch during
 training.
* Loss poisoning - modifies the loss value during training (supports dynamic
 loss balancing, see  [Sec 3.4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03823) )

*TODO*: model poisoning (good place to contribute!).

### Datasets
* Image Classification - ImageNet, CIFAR-10, Pipa face identification, 
MultiMNIST, MNIST.
* Text - IMDB reviews datasets, Reddit (coming)

*TODO*: Face recognition, eg Celeba or VGG. We already have some code, but need
 expertise on producing good models (good place to contribute!).

### Defenses
* Input perturbation -
[NeuralCleanse](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/backdoor-sp19.pdf) + 
added evasion.
* Model anomalies - [SentiNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00292.pdf) + added
 evasion.
* Spectral clustering / fine-pruning + added evasion.

*TODO*: Port Jupyter notebooks demonstrating defenses and evasions. Add new
 defenses and evasions (good place to contribute!).

### Training regimes

* Centralized training.
* Differentially private / gradient shaping training.
* Federated Learning (CIFAR-10 only).

## Basics

First, we want to give some background on backdoor attacks, note that our
 definition is inclusive of many other definitions stated before and supports
 all the new attacks (e.g. clean-label, feature-mix, semantic).

1. **Deep Learning**. We focus on supervised learning setting where our goal is to
 learn some task ***m*: X -> Y** (we call it a *main* [task](tasks/task.py)) on some
  domain of
  inputs **X** 
and labels **Y**. 
A model **θ** for task ***m*** is trained on tuples **(x,y) ∈ (X,Y)** using 
some loss criterion **L** (e.g. cross-entropy): **L(θ(x), y)**.   

1. **Backdoor definition.** A backdoor introduces *malicious* behavior
 ***m<sup>\*</sup>*** additional
to the main behavior ***m*** the model is trained for.  Therefore, we state
 that a backdoor attack is 
essentially a multi-task setting with two or more tasks: main task ***m***
and backdoor task  ***m<sup>\*</sup>***, and if needed evasion tasks ***m<sub>ev
</sub>***. The model trained for two tasks will exhibit both normal and
 backdoor behavior.

2. **Backdoor data**. In order to introduce a backdoor task
***m<sup>\*</sup>*: X<sup>\*</sup> -> Y<sup>\*</sup>**
the model has to be trained on a different domain of backdoor inputs and
 labels: (**X<sup>\*</sup>**, **Y<sup>\*</sup>**). Intuitively we can 
 differentiate that the backdoor domain **X<sup>\*</sup>** contains
 inputs that contain backdoor features. The main domain **X** might also
  include backdoor inputs, i.e. when backdoors are naturally occurring features.
  However, note that the
 input domain **X<sup>\*</sup>** should not prevail in the main task domain 
  **X**, e.g. **X \\ X<sup>\*</sup> ≈ 0**, otherwise two tasks will collude.
  
3. **Backdoor feature.** Initially, a backdoor trigger was defined as a pixel
 pattern, therefore clearly separating the backdoor domain **X<sup>\*</sup>**
  from the main domain **X**. However, recent works on semantic backdoors, 
  edge-case backdoors and physical backdoors allow the backdoor feature to be
   a part of the unmodified input (ie. a particular model of a car or an
   airplane that will be misclassified as birds).
   
   We propose to use [`synthesizers`](synthesizers/synthesizer.py) that transform non
   -backdoored inputs
    to contain backdoor features and create backdoor labels. For example in
     image backdoors. The input synthesizer can simply insert a pixel pattern
      on top of an image,
     perform more complex transformations, or substitute the image with a
      backdoored image (edge-case backdoors). 

4. **Complex backdoors.** A domain of backdoor labels **Y<sup>\*</sup>** can 
contain many labels. This setting is different from all other
 backdoor attacks, where the presence of a backdoor feature would always result
  in a specific label. However, our setting allows a new richer set of attacks
for example a model trained on a task to count people
 in the image might contain a backdoor task to identify particular
  individuals. 

4. **Supporting multiple backdoors.** Our definition enables multiple
 backdoor tasks. As a toy example we can attack a model that recognizes a two
 -digit
 number and inject two new backdoor tasks: one that sums up digits and another 
 one that multiplies them. 


5. **Methods to inject backdoor task.** Depending on a selected threat
model the attack can inject backdoors by
poisoning the training dataset, directly mixing backdoor inputs into a
training batch, altering loss functions, or modifying model weights. Our
framework supports all these methods, but primarily focuses on injecting
backdoors by adding a special loss value. We also utilize Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm ([MGDA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04650)) to
efficiently balance multiple losses.

## Installation

Now, let's configure the system: 
* Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
* Create two directories: `runs` for Tensorboard graphs and `saved_models` to
 store results. 
* Startup Tensorboard: `tensorboard --logdir=runs/`.

Next, let's run some basic attack on MNIST dataset. We use YAML files to
 configure the attacks. For MNIST attack, please refer to the [`configs
 /mnist_params.yaml`](./configs/mnist_params.yaml) file. For the full set of
  available
  parameters see the
  dataclass [`Parameters`](./utils/parameters.py). Let's start the training:
  
  ```shell script
python training.py --name mnist --params configs/mnist_params.yaml --commit none
```
 
Argument `name` specifies Tensorboard name and commit just records the
 commit id into a log file for reproducibility.
 
 
## Repeating Experiments

For imagenet experiments you can use `imagenet_params.yaml`.

  ```shell script
python training.py --name imagenet --params configs/imagenet_params.yaml --commit none
```


## Structure

Our framework includes a training file [`training.py`](training.py) that
heavily relies on a [`Helper`](helper.py) object storing all the necessary
objects for training. The helper object contains the main 
[`Task`](tasks/task.py)  that stores models, datasets, optimizers, and
other parameters for the training. Another object [`Attack`](attack.py
) contains synthesizers and performs
loss computation for multiple tasks.
